;;; Commentary:

;; I keep all my abbreviations here. I don't have any abbreviations that are
;; specific to some major mode, so I just edit `global-abbrev-table'. As you
;; can see I use abbreviations mainly for inserting of Unicode symbols that
;; otherwise are difficult to type on standard keyboards.
