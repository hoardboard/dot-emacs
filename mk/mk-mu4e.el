;;; Commentary:

;; MU4E configuration I use to manage emails from Emacs.  See the readme
;; file of this configuration for detailed instructions how to make this
;; work on Arch Linux.  In short, you will need to setup the following
;; external packages:
;;
;; * ‘offlineimap’
;; * ‘mu’
;; * ‘gnutls’

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'smtpmail)
  (require 'starttls))

(require 'f)
(require 'mu4e nil t)

(setq
 mu4e-maildir                  (f-expand "~/Maildir")
 mu4e-drafts-folder            "/Drafts"
 mu4e-sent-folder              "/Sent"
 mu4e-trash-folder             "/Trash"
