;;; Prolog mode settings.

;;; Code:

(require 'mk-utils)

;; open .pl files as Prolog files, not Perl files
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.pl\\'" . prolog-mode))

(add-to-list 'major-mode-alias '(prolog-inferior-mode . "iP"))
(add-to-list 'major-mode-alias '(prolog-mode          . "P"))

(provide 'mk-prolog)

;;; mk-prolog.el ends here
