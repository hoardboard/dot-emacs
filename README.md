# Emacs Configuration Files

These are my Emacs and GNUS configuration files. I wrote these files slowly
borrowing useful things that I saw in Emacs configuration files of other
people and official GNU Emacs manuals. However, I've written quite a bit of
stuff myself, because I couldn't find decent solutions.

The `.emacs` file defines function to search Internet with DuckDuckGo. It
generates such URLs so DuckDuckGo operates in HTML mode, without any
proprietary Java Script. Also the URLs include parameters to remove ads
(well, a sponsored link in results is not a big deal anyway). It also forces
DuckDuckGo work only via HTTPS.

Also, here is some automation to install all necessary packages and some
automation to compile/recompile SLIME (works smoothly with Quicklisp).

I have written a function to upgrade all packages without displaying
`*Packages*` buffer. This function directly finds all obsolete packages,
asks if user want to upgrade and if he/she really wants to, install fresh
versions of packages automatically deleting obsolete versions.

To send emails with Emacs and read emails with GNUS, you need to create a
file called `.authinfo.gpg` in your home directory. As its extension
suggests, you better encrypt this sort of information. The file should have
the following form:

```
machine HOST port NUMBER login NAME password VALUE
```

You need two such lines: one for SMTP and another one for IMAP. For example,
I use:

```
machine smtp.openmailbox.org port 587 login myemail@opmbx.org password "foo"
machine imap.openmailbox.org port 993 login myemail@opmbx.org password "foo"
```

To use spell-checking you need to install `aspell` from repositories of your
favorite GNU/Linux distribution.

## Shortcuts

Don't use hairy default Emacs shortcuts. All frequently used commands must
be as simple as possible. Prefer single keys and key sequences to
key-chords. Even if it's not faster, it's good for your health.
